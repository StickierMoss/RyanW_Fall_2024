This is a 2D platformer designed as a final project for ECE 287: Digital Systems Design at Miami University. With the  aim to create a skill based game were players control a character's location on a screen in an attempt to get to a desired location.
## Overview
Players control the red block by press KEY[0] KEY[1] and KEY[2]. 
Corresponding to the following movement;
KEY [0] --> Move Right
KEY [1] --> Jump
KEY [2] --> Move Left

## The game features:

3 levels and a Victory Screen.

6 different platforms each with unique mechanics.

3 unique respawn locations for each corresponding level.

Variable gravity (to increment y movement).

AABB collision detection.

Movement left and right.

Clock divisor control used for collision debugging.


## Project Design
The project consists of several key modules;

plaformer.v: Top-level module.

player_init.v: Generates player size, initial location, and if the player is able to be seen.

player_update.v: Manages the players collision detection, virticle, and horizontal movement.

platformer_display.v: Shows location of collidable platforms, players location, types of platforms based on color, and areas of danger. 

vga_driver.v: Manages VGA output.

## Playing the game
Turn on switches[2:0] for the intended playing speed.

Turn on switch[9] to start the game.

KEY[0] moves your red block right.
KEY[2] moves your red block left.
KEY[1] makes your red block jump.

Try your best to reach the gold platform!

The vga_driver.v module was written by Huan Dang in https://github.com/HuanProjects/ECE287_checker/tree/main

The module audio_controller.v was inspired by a similar audio controller generated by https://www.perplexity.ai/

The projects skeleton was inspired by another group written by Liam and Micheal in https://github.com/liamogw/guitar-hero

## Conclusions
This project did not include all intended features finishing with only three levels from the proposed 8 and did not include moving platform detection as I had ran out of time on the project.

Design Results
The completed design takes 60 ALM's, and 56 logic registers when optimized in Quartus.
